              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EFE7E6;"></span>
                  #EFE7E6
                  <em>This pink color shows the femininity of our target group, however we don't want to make it seem childish and stereotypical, which is why we added a grey tint. </em>

                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #DFBCC4;"></span>
                  #DFBCC4
                  <em>This pink color was also added for the femininity of our target group, however it was made darker in order to also have a darker tint of pink in our style guide. </em>

                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2D833E;"></span>

                  <em>This green color was added to signify soccer, since our target group is female soccer players. Green signifies the gras they play on.</em>

                  #A9C8B4
                  <em>This green color was also added to signify soccer, since our target group is female soccer players. There is also a grey tint in this shade, adding to the more professional look of the website.</em>
                </li>
				  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EDC398"></span>
                  #EDC398
                  <em>This orange color was added to signify the nationality of our target group. Since our target group is Dutch, the orange shade fits the country.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Font choices<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li class="titlefont">
				Our titlefont is Belleza, this font was chosen to show femininity, but to also look more intelligent for out target audience.</li>
				<li>
				Our font for the body is Roboto, this also signifies intelligence for our target audience.</li></ul></li>
            <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  <ul class="list-unstyled"> 
			  <li>On the opening of our page we first show the logo, in order to first show the audience the feel of our website and brand. Below this we show all the community parts of the website; the chat, groups and blog options. These pictures are clickable, making it quick and easy to see all the parts of the community and to easily be able to navigate to them.</li>
			  <li>On the "About Us" page we start with the name of our brand and a brief description, this will give the audience a very quick overview should they not want to read anything else. After this we start with our vision and mission, for this section there are no pictures, because it is very important to us that our vision and mission come across clearly without distractions. After this the values are shown in a grid, in order to also give a quick overview of the amount of values we have.</li>
			  <li>After this is the "Blog" page, here we have chosen to quickly give the audience a feel of every blog post, by showing a carousel, which they can also navigate themselves. The title is also included to give a quick overview of what every blog post is about. By pressing oon the learn more button, you are transferred to the blog post related to the title. We added a back button the the blog posts, to make it easier to navigate back to the overview of blog posts.</li>
			  <li>In the "chats" page it is easy to chat within the groups you're in. If you were to have joined multiple groups you could the tabs to choose the different groups you want to chat with.</li>
			  <li>In the "groups" page you can see all the different groups that are available for you to join. For this we chose to have cards, in order to give a quick overview of every groups and by adding the "join" button, we wanted to make it easy to join whatever group you would like to join.</li>
			  <li>For the "Brand Deals" page we also chose to use cards to give a quick overview, along with the "apply" button to make it easy to apply for a brand deal of your choice.</li>
			  <li>We decided to add a "Log In" page, because if players want to join groups, brand deals, chat with other people and write blogs, they need to have an account in order to for instance remember which groups they are a part of.</li></ul>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages):</li>
			  <ul class="list-unstyled"> 
			  <li>We chose to first put the "about us" page in the navigation bar. This was chosen, because our brand also wants to create awareness around the problems in the female soccer industry, therefore we first want to share our vision and mission to make this as clear as possible. </li>
			  <li>After this we chose to put the community part of our website in the navigation bar, this then has a dropdown with the chat, blog and groups. With our website we want to create a community of female soccer players. With the chat, they are able to chat with each other, they can read other players' blogs through blogs and join groups of players through groups. These functions are all a part of the community we are trying to build.</li>
			  <li>Next in the navigation bar, we chose to put the "Brand Deals" page, this page is also very important to us, because this is an option to make more income for the female players, since soccer doesn't always make them enough to sustain them during and after their career. However, this page doesn't necessarily fit the community part of the website and therefore has it's own tab.</li>
			  <li>After this is the "Log In"page, giving the players the option to log in to chat with others and see the groups and brand deals they have joined.</li></ul>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Equal career opportunities for men and women is something that still is not guaranteed in the world. It is difficult for women to have a career in football because there is no security of what happens after their career. For men this is different, there are a lot of job opportunities that pay very well for men after their football careers. Old male professionals are employed for instance as TV analysts or receive a job internally at a football club. Another thing is that male footballers have earned much more during their career in comparison to females, which reduces a lot of the pressure in finding a new career path. If you are not an ultimate superstar in women’s football, there is no stability in your life after your career. This results in lesser career opportunities for young women who have the dream and talent to pursue a career in football. The fact that there is no time during a career to specialize in a different career makes becoming a pro an enormous risk. That is why there has to come a long-term solution, a solution that gives women the chance to showcase their talent to the world with no worries about their life outside of football. That is why we want to target the audience of all the players in the women’s Eredivisie. Kick Her Goals is a platform that helps women with this problem connect and come to this solution together. There should be conversations about a short-term solution for the women who are suffering from these problems now. And a solution that helps women build a good foundation under the rising industry that women’s football is. This to grow to income of the industry and help these women get paid. Because when there is enough income created in the industry and the demand rises to as high as the male demand that is when both male and females have equal opportunities. Kick her Goals is the platform where people fighting this problem can come together and discuss possible solutions with the goal to help each other.</p>

						<li>
The posts were written in a proactive way. The reason for this is to motivate the person reading this post to come to action. We want our target audience to feel heard and make them feel like our platform is the place where they can better their lives. One of the categories of different posts that were done were job opportunities, this is one of many ways to help out our target audience while scrolling through the Instagram page. The reason we chose job opportunities like for instance a sports modelling job is of course to reach someone who might be interested in this specific job, but also to inspire about the different opportunities for these athletes. Someone within our target audience who is reading this post might have never thought of this as a job for them. 
We also started posting stories on our profile, this in two different categories. One of them with news surrounding the subject, these posts are done to make someone who still is not aware about the differences between male and females players join our movement. An example of this was a post of an enormous transfer in women’s football which was 800 thousand euros, this is pocket change in the males competition. 
The other category was about women telling stories, with our research in the communication plan we found that to influence women they want to hear other women speak. It can also be motivating and uplifting to see successful women, this can provide the feeling that it is possible to overcome the difficulties they face. </li>
<li>With 2 billion users, Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms out there. The platform will be great for us to have a platform that showcases all the important information that should be provided about our brand to the target audience. With Instagram being so popular, it is the right platform to keep our target audience up to date with all the latest news and development surrounding the brand. Doing this via Instagram works much better than having to depend on people visiting the website as their own initiative. Important people connected to our brand like football teams or players are already active on Instagram and have a following. Through these accounts, we can reach even more people to support the brand. With a follower and like count Instagram makes it easy to measure progress of the brand. With this it can be measured if certain other marketing strategies are being effective. 
Instagram will be used to measure two of our goals (Reach and response).

						<li>With almost 500 million users and the largest active age group being our target audience, Pinterest will be a great platform to market our brand. The Pinterest algorithm also helps with this. The content shown to the user by the platform is based on the previous behavior of the user. Meaning what this person has clicked on, saved or shared with someone.  
Our target audience being into sports and being on this platform will result in a situation of them seeing our product in their app in between other football posts. The problem that we are fighting against with our brand is something that our target audience lives with on a daily basis. This means that they think of this problem a lot and rightfully so. Their internet behavior is also based on this. Thanks to this, it is easier for us to reach them on a platform that shapes the shown content with the behavior of the user. 
Pinterest has something on their website called ‘’pin quality’. What this means is the more clicks something gets, the more it is shown to people. With our brand being something that can help change the lives of our target audience we expect them to click on our brand resulting in the brand being shown to more and more people.  
Pinterest is used for reaching our goal about feel because with the mood boards on Pinterest we can provide this to users.
</li>
<li>On Pinterest we made mood boards, this was to give an overall feeling of the brand. But what does that mean. 
After doing research about what makes women feel actually heard, we found a lot of information about pink washing. Pink washing is when the color pink is overly used when a product or service is being targeted towards women. We found that this makes women feel like they are not being taken serious. With feeling of the brand we mean colors, way of speaking to these women and some information so that readers know what this brand is about. </li>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 titlefont">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We for sure learned that in some occasions less is more, during the creation of the logo and the content we went all out when designing because we wanted to showcase or skills within this. But the style of design which first was very bright colors and a lot of cartoons did not match with our message. Our message is serious, and we want our targeted audience to feel like they are being taken serious. Although we would like to go all out with bright and new designs, we had to create something that connected with our message. That is why we had multiple logos, and every time they became more simple.  
This was a disappointment at first but after having an overall discussion we came to the conclusion that this was better for the brand we were trying to create. 
</p>
		  <p>We learned that overall cohesiveness is crucial in providing a good end product. For this multiple things were important like communication and preparation. It was important to have good discussions within our group to make sure everyone working on something different still provided something that connected to the other parts. We had a lot of discussions about what we thought was best for the overall success of the brand, and quickly noticed different ideas within the group. It was important to make sure everyone knew what the eventual plan was. </p>
		  <p>We learned that when focussing on a very specific target audience, it is easier to shape the brand. In our case, these were women professional football players. Because this target audience was so specific we could do research very well and find out exactly what works and what does not work within this target audience, the pink washing is an example of this.  </p>
		  <p>Something that we should do differently next time is asking for feedback from people within our target audience from early on. At this moment we do not know if any of our strategies will actually be effective, although we think that marketing ourselves this way is our best bet at success, we do not know if it will work. This can be done by sending out surveys to people within our target audience or messaging them through social media to receive feedback. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 titlefont">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>The first thing that we would do if the project continued was asking for feedback from people within our target audience. We would do this by sending dm’s via Instagram and asking them what they think. Their feedback will be important because only when our target audience gives a green light we can continue going in the direction that we are going in now. The things that we would ask feedback on would be the content on the website, the overall feel as described before and if we are missing certain things that they think would benefit our platform. </p>
          <p>We would do this via a survey, the survey would consist of questions like:
		  <ul class="list">
			  <li> What do you feel when visiting our webpage?</li>
		  <li>What benefits did our Instagram page provide to you?</li>
		  <li>What was the overall feeling you got after visiting our Pinterest page?</li>
		  <li>What values that we provide actually add something to your future?</li>
		  <li>Is there something that you dislike on our page?</li></ul></p>
          <p>How we would go further would be decided when the results of the survey are in.
If people within our target audience are positive we would continue on this path with posting mood via Pinterest, and we would keep the specific categories on Instagram the same. 
If the feedback revealed that one of our social media pages does not add any benefits, we would explore other social media pages.
We would start doing research on marketing via Facebook and TikTok and after our research decide on one of those two. Then we would start a new campaign on this platform and ask for feedback after, all of this until we get a majority of positive reviews.
</p>
		<p>The most important recommendation for the future is to understand the target audience. These are not little girls that need help with a small problem. We are talking about professional athletes that have problems that could seriously influence their mental wellbeing that is why there should be no pink washing. The website should be professional and remain giving them solutions and most importantly hope. </p>
		<p>What would work better in the future is working together even more as a group, doing every single part of this project together. This will make the end result a well-structured consistent product. As we found this is very important when looking at the professionalism of a brand. And the professionalism is very important for our target audience who want to be taken serious.
